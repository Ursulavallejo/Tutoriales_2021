Notes:

#Typescript language:
> Strong typing (type of variable), easy to debug.
> Object-oriented features, classes/ interfaces/ constructors / access modifiers (public-private)/ fields / properties.
> Compile-time errors
> Great tooling

- Most browsers don't understand Typescript for that reason is need it to build our application in a process called Transpile ( compilation of TS to JS/transcrypt).

## How to install :

- Go to terminal and install globally in our machine:

```shell
npm install -g typescript
If Mac > sudo npm install -g typescript

tsc --version  / tsc.cmd -v
tsc.cmd --init
```

- To compile the file TS to JS (terminal): typescript compiler
```shell

tsc main.ts
tsc.cmd main.ts

ls  / to see the files in that folder

```

-To run with Node:
```shell
node main.js
```

- To remove files:
```shell
 rm main.js
```
